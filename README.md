# About Me

I'm a Navy veteran, ex web dev, mathematician, and data scientist. I deeply love solving complex problems by leveraging my creativity and love of math to deliver novel solutions to complex problems. This usually manifests in me prototyping various tools to address these needs. It can range from creating a vacation planning tool that models my itinerary as a traveling salesman problem to integrating chat GPT into iMessages so that it can automatically respond to people to texts when I'm busy.

One of my eventual goals is to integrate my custom priority queue system with my Obsidian notes graph, and my own LLM to create a personalized AI assistant.

Some fun stuff I've worked on:

1. Technical interview [problem](https://github.com/Unobtainiumrock/custom-problem-sets/tree/master/circle-toy-problem) I crafted for candidates to work on the NIST project 
2. Transaction Schedule to Cnflict Graph [tool](https://github.com/Unobtainiumrock/transaction-schedule-to-conflict-graph) that pertains to [Story 1 (Improved Learning Process Through Tooling)](#story-1-improved-learning-process-through-tooling)
3. [Travel Plan Optimizer](https://github.com/Unobtainiumrock/travel-optimizer). Revisiting this one later, its something I built to optimize travel plans this summer in Barcelona. It models it as a traveling salesman problem and in its current state, still involves some manual input to external tooling for mapping out itineraries.


# Why I'm Interested?

My interest in this role is that I can be the person to solve the problem on both sides. Customers might not even know what their problem is. They might be like "hey this product is not working, we're not getting what we want, something is wrong, we need you to come and fix it", but sometimes they might lead you on a wild goose chase and the part they thought was the problem wasn't event he source to begin with and this is where deep technical knowledge of the product comes into play.

One of my favorite things to do when solving a problem is don my more mathematical thinking cap. I start with several things, but one of my favorites is to prove/disprove the core assumptions people are making when interacting with a problem they're stuck on. More often than not, the cases where people get stuck, the root of the problem lies in some false core assumptions being made about how a system behaves. I love this because a big thing for me is having ownership over all aspects of the solutions and get the holistic picture

A deep understanding of the technical product allows me compile problems from client side and bring them back to company to drive the improvement of product features and I find that to be very rewarding.

The role appeals to me because even though it's not software engineering focused or really code-heavy, it still exercises a lot of the same thought processes. It requires a systems thinking mindset where you need to be aware of both the customer's needs and the broader technical and business ecosystem. Much like engineering roles, this position demands a holistic understanding of how different components interact and influence each other. You're constantly solving complex problems, optimizing processes, and ensuring that solutions are scalable and sustainable. It's about designing and implementing systems that not only meet immediate requirements but also anticipate future challenges and opportunities

If I understand correctly, in this role, I'll essentially be crafting solutions, but instead of just writing code, I'll be integrating various technologies, coordinating between different stakeholders, and fine-tuning processes to deliver increase product value for the end users. The critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation required are very much aligned with how I approach problem solving.

# How Does This Align With My Goals?

A big part of what excites me is the company's research focused origins and the fact that many of the employees have some level of technical background. It is an awesome place to exchange ideas with peers and connect with new people that have experiences I want to learn from.

I intend on being in a role like this anywhere from two to give years after which I will apply to a masters data science program (or concurrently do part time). Having peers to learn from within the company and having industry knowledge of where AI products can deliver value to customers helps me determine what specific area of AI that I want to specialize in and will help guide my decision making process on what programs I apply for.

## Cross Functionality as the Art of Managing Expectations

My view on working effectively in a cross-functional manner as a "middle man" involves the art of managing expectations in the language of each stakeholder. 

I break this down into the following rough process:

1. Identify the key terminology each stakeholder uses and what their preferred modes of communication are.
2. Model the flow of information as a pipeline or graph, with the endpoint/sink being the desired outcome.
3. Start at the earliest stage in the pipeline and gather the first stakeholder's expectations
4. Next translate these expectations and requirements into terms the engineering teams can act on and determine what information they need/expect in order to deliver results.
5. Go back to the previous stakeholder with the additional requirements (if any) translated into terms they can understand.
6. Do this until each team is satisfied within some threshold.
7. Create a timeline to complete these tasks, where critical tasks that block the project flow are identified early and prioritized accordingly.
8. Share this information with each stakeholder in terms they can understand and make sure everybody agrees within some threshold.

This will obviously get more complex as interractions potentially span many degrees of freedom away from one another and will have to be addressed in their own unique ways. 

I felt that my stories regarding cross-functional work werent sufficient because of the low number of stakeholders and the minimal number of degrees of separation. This was why I stumbled a bit about story telling.

# Story 1 Overview

"The MCLE role extends to educating customers on machine learning concepts, proposing creative solutions"
 This example shows experience in easing the learning process through tooling, albeit still focused on the technical audience.

## Key Points

- What Desmos has done for functions visually, my tool has done for transaction schedules as conflict graphs.
- A lack of repetitions and hard to come up with examples was a primary motivation
Tool allowed me to rapidly pick up the concept
- Shared the idea with other classmates and generated interest from staff who asked me to continue development on it for future semesters.
- Showcases leveraging technical skills to break down complex topics into simpler forms through visualization
- Showcases using creativity to explain or simplify technical concepts in a more welcoming form. 

## Story 1 (Improved Learning Process Through Tooling)

**What was the problem?**

In my data engineering class, we were learning about something called transaction schedules. This is just a fancy term for a collection of transactions (database operations), where each transaction contains database operations such as read/write. We were being taught about how these schedules can either be classified in two different ways (serial or non-serial) and that depending on what the schedule contains, it can be changed to run in a more optimal form. One of the ways that we could quickly determine whether or not they could be changed into this optimal form was to create a visual representation of them. This visualization consisted of circles and lines connecting them –these are called conflict graphs. If a cycle existed in a graph (draw a picture), then that would tell us that the schedule is not eligible to be converted into an optimal form.

The course only showed maybe one or two examples of transaction schedules and their corresponding conflict graphs. I felt that this wasn't a sufficient number of examples to really internalize the patterns. I had lots of questions like "what if I changed this one aspect? What would that change in the conflict graph?" I also predicted that future exams would have a question dedicated either to creating a conflict graph from a transaction schedule or vice versa. I wanted to be able to practice and drill problems like this so that it would feel like second nature.

I believe that a key to quickly learning new concepts requires copious amounts of input/output examples and is analogous to how we train neural networks with large datasets, so I set out to build a tool that would generate conflict graphs, given a transaction schedule. 

You can think of this problem as being similar to:

If mathematically oriented: how when you're first learning about parabolic functions and their corresponding plots. Maybe in class you're learning about them, but they only show a few examples. This fails to capture which components of the function are responsible for concavity, sharpness of the parabola, and its left/right & up/down translation. It's much easier to tease out the patterns and rules of parabolic functions when you can turn all dials of the various parameters and observe in live time out that influences the visual output. I aimed to do what Desmos does for functions, but for conflict graphs.

else: if you were learning how to speak a new language via video content captioned in your native language, but only one video with captions existed. My tool would generate lots of video content with different plots and dialogue to teach you other aspects of that language.

**How did my tool help solve this?**

Having this tool allowed me to quickly generate lots of examples I could use for practice problems. It would quickly generate the visual representations of the transaction schedules, thus solving the problem of a lack of "training points" preventing us from iterating quickly on ideas.

**What was the outcome?**

The tool not only allowed me to more quickly learn this concept, but it also allowed me to get really fast at converting back and forth between the two representations. I ended up sharing this tool with my classmates on our course discussion board and it generated interest and excitement from the staff. The professor was also interested in me continuing development on the tool so that she could use it in future courses. 

# Story 2 Overview

Role seems troubleshooting heavy –So definitely good to share my experience or mindset & approach on this (specifically, how do I go about diagnosing root cause, trending issues to facilitate task prioritization so I can group issues into categories and find the most find the most urgent ones, what type of information do I gather and from who, what process I follow to design & conduct testing, data analysis, reporting style of reached,conclusions).

## Key Points

- Great example of troubleshooting a problem
- Showcases problem solving strategies
- Identified a problem: Manual tasks that could be automated with scripts in sheets.
- Presented a prototype: Showed the student a baby prototype for automation.
- Positive reception: The student liked the idea and decided to adopt it.
- Encountered issues: The student faced problems with the process and output.
- Complex pipeline: Transformation pipeline was large and ingested input from many sheets.
- Data issues: Missing values and garbled characters in the data.
- Root cause analysis: Assumed incorrect assumptions were causing the issues.
- Detailed breakdown: Broke down the transformation pipeline into individual components.
- Whiteboard session: Discussed terminologies and components on a whiteboard.
- Step-by-step verification: Verified expected data dimensions before and after each transformation.
- Pinpointed errors: Identified where incorrect assumptions were made.
- Technical resolution: Used knowledge of character encoding to resolve smart quotes issues.
- Successful outcome: Created a smoothly running automated workflow.
- Impressed team: The team was impressed and wanted a presentation on incorporating the solution.

## Troubleshooting Steps

- Ask them what their desired output is so that I can get the big picture.
- Then I ask them what their current approach is and to walk me through it up to their roadblock and while we're doing that I whiteboard down what they say into clearly defined atomic steps so that they can be individually tested b/c I find that visual representations eliminate a lot of miscommunication.
- Once we arrive at the roadblock, we clearly define what that is, i.e. how the current output differs from the expected output.
- After that, we go through each step and list out all the key assumptions made because more often than not, a lot of problems that people get stuck on boil down to some false or absent assumptions.
- Then after we're listed these out, we run through the process and verify that our assumptions are aligned with the result.
- As we went through this the problems naturally emerged and there were indeed places where our assumptions were not aligned with our outputs. More specifically, there were some false assumptions about regex behavior and edge cases.

## Story 2 (Excellent Troubleshooting Example)

I'm good at solving problems at their root cause. For example, I was recently helping a masters student with their lab work and I realized they were doing a lot of manual tasks that could be automated with scripts in sheets, so I presented them with a baby prototype of how it could work. They liked the idea a lot and went ahead and decided to adopt it. They came back to me a few days later because they were having some trouble with the process and couldn't understand where things were going wrong and they weren't getting their desired output. Their approach was complex because the transformation pipeline was very large and it ingested input across many sheets. There were missing values they expected to have and in other places, the data was a garbled mess of nonsensical characters.

In my experience, it's often the case that the root cause of a problem lies in some incorrect assumption. So what I decided to do was break down the transformation pipeline into their smallest individual transformation components and have her walk me through her process. I invited her to a whiteboard session and we came up with all the agreed upon terminologies and drew out all the components. We went over each stage in the pipeline and I asked her what the expected dimensions of the data were before transforming and after transforming and if each incremental result was consistent with their key assumptions and expectations. By checking if the expectations were met or not, we were able to pinpoint where incorrect assumptions were being made and troubleshoot from there.

We were eventually able to track down and correct the problem. The process also involved leveraging my technical knowledge of character encoding to resolve a problem caused by smart quotes causing unexpected behavior as well. The end result was that we not only had a smoothly running automated workflow that saved lots of manual work hours, but her team was also really impressed and wanted her to give a presentation on how they could also incorporate it into their workflows.

# Story 3 Overview

## Key Points

- Identified a problem: Manual tasks that could be automated with scripts in sheets.
- Presented a prototype: Showed the student a baby prototype for automation.
- Positive reception: The student liked the idea and decided to adopt it.
- Encountered issues: The student faced problems with the process and output.
- Complex pipeline: Transformation pipeline was large and ingested input from many sheets.
- Data issues: Missing values and garbled characters in the data.

- Pinpointed errors: Identified where incorrect assumptions were made.
- Technical resolution: Used knowledge of character encoding to resolve smart quotes issues.
- Successful outcome: Created a smoothly running automated workflow.
- Impressed team: The team was impressed and wanted a presentation on incorporating the solution.

## Story 3 (Task Management & Prioritization)

I actually had to do something along these lines while I was with NIST. I had to make the hard decision of giving a teammate some of the tasks that I would consider more mundane. I recognized very early on that this person had an innate ability and excellent experience in project management. They were good at holding people accountable, coordinating meetings, and documenting project outcomes. Our project hit a technical roadblock I knew would require technical know-how and that I had the necessary skills to overcome it. Given this information, the best move forward to overcoming this roadblock would require me to delegate more of those tasks to her so that I could fix the issues we were facing. What made this decision difficult was that I knew that this project was an exciting opportunity for her to grow and learn more about training neural networks and that she'd have to take on some less exciting work during that period.

So what I did was I came to her and told her that she has a really great knack at handling this type of work and that I could really use her help handling it while I pivoted to fix our current problem. The alternative is that I would have to dedicate time to explain what our exact problem was and how we could handle it and then teach the techniques necessary (it was a very niche issue). I told her that I know that this isn't the most exciting stuff to do right now, but that our priority is to keep meeting our deliverables and I offered the opportunity for her to shadow me while I worked on the high priority item, provided that her other tasks were already finished. 

She ended up being more motivated to finish her work quickly and accurately, leading to faster results because she was excited to shadow me. She ended up learning more about the mathematical side of our work, while shadowing me, and I showed her my methodology of breaking down problems into their atomic components and verifying all assumptions along the way. These sessions became valuable in later stages of the project where she applied my troubleshooting techniques to debugging a dimensionality error that was causing unexpected behavior in our neural network training code.


## Effective Team Notes

**Key Aspects of a good team leader**:

1. Establish what forms of communication each person prefers
2. Be able to communicate early and often
3. Determine what skills each person possesses and where they excel
4. Find out what motivates each of your team members and learn to leverage that.


**Things to keep in mind when it comes to communication styles**:

1. How should people keep each other updated on progress?
2. What mediums of communication should the team use and for what purposes?
3. How should one make requests for help?
4. How does the team want to give each other feedback?
5. How often should you be having meetings?
6. How will decisions be made?

# Areas I Need to Improve/ Post Interview Notes

1. Practice better story telling by rehearsing in the mirror.
2. Get better at not letting my nerves get to me or thinking my stories are inadequate. This prevented my from fully delivering them when it mattered most.
3. Its okay to read sections from my notes verbatim if I feel stuck. Do this next time!
4. I planned to incorporate a shared whiteboard into my story telling, but didn't follow through with it. Stick to my plan in the moment next time.
5. Its not cool of me to go into the meeting and deliver sub-par story-telling and expect interviewers to spend more of their valuable time post-meeting going over docs I share with them. Maybe in addition to sharing a collaborative whiteboard, I can share my screen with them so they can see my preparation doc.
6. The biggest recurring thing I've seen every interviewer thus far express concerns about is:
    - How well does this role align with the interviewees goals?
    - Does the interviewee realize to what extent this deviates from ML engineering or other stem roles? If so, are they okay with this?
    - Does the role excite the interviewee?
    - How well will this person perform in the capacity of cross-functional teamwork? This one is HUGE for them and its at the heart of the role. Their ideal candidate not only has the preferred qualifications, but knows how to capitalize on them to deliver customer value.
    - My only saving grace after this interview is if I can make it to the technical one and showcase how effectively I can problem solve.
7. I prepared so much and talked with a friend about how a big part of solving a problem boiled down to incorrect assumptions being made within stakeholders processes and that locating these nearly always solved the problem at hand. So why didn't I mention this?
8. 

# Next Steps & Tasks

- [ ] Infer what the technical demo interview is all about
- [ ] Watch the YT video of the product being used. Take notes, pause frequently to determine what each aspect of the system uses. Try to build a copycat prototype to showcase a deep technical understanding of how things are used.
- [ ] Finish reading the research paper on programmatic labeling.
- [ ] Add into my project requirements gathering process that I create throrough markdown documentation with an estimated timeline laid out to the clients.
- [ ] Hash out and develop my story about helping a consulting firm during a client's re-org by introducing process automation. Really focus in on how I simplified this problem by nailing down clear definitions of what stakeholder's requirements are. I often found that when I ask clarifying questions that they realize where information was lacking.
- [] To showcase the ability to dumb down really technical stuff into simpler to understand terms, I should practice verbalizing this in the mirror.
- [ ] Both Matty and Priyush mentioned stuff like troubleshooting the deployment of models. Dig deeper into this. Figure out what kind of tooling might be involved during the demo interview.
